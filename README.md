The BrailleR package is a collection of tools to make use of R a happier experience for blind people.


### Blind people's use of R

Blind people cannot use RStudio and depending on the combination of operating system and screen reading software we choose to use, we might have differing levels of success with the standard R GUI.

R is perhaps the most blind-friendly statistical software option because all scripts are written in plain text, using the text editor a user prefers, and all output can be saved in a wide range of file formats. The advent of R markdown and other reproducible research techniques can offer the blind user a degree of efficiency that is not offered in many other statistical software options.


###  Specific objectives of BrailleR

1. Make accessing output simpler.
2. Gain access to the content depicted in a graph.
3. Help get inot R markdown easier.
5. Replace the tasks other users can do quickly using the RStudio IDE.

### You can help

Any assistance in helping fill in the numerous gaps in the what BrailleR delivers will be most gratefully received.
